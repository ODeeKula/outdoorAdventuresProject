                <p> Rock climbing is an activity in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. The goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a pre-defined route without falling. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climberâ€™s strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control.

                <p> Fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. Fish are normally caught in the wild. Techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. Fishing may include catching aquatic animals other than fish, such as molluscs, cephalopods, crustaceans, and echinoderms. The term is not normally applied to catching farmed fish, or to aquatic mammals, such as whales where the term whaling is more appropriate.</p>

                <p> Hiking is taking a long walk in the countryside, usually for pleasure or exercise. There are many hiking trails in our Country Parks, and they are all managed by the Country and Marine Parks Authority. To manage hiking trails in remote areas is an extremely demanding task, so you can help by taking your litter home after hiking.In a city where its most famous landmark is a mountain, it's only fitting that in this picture comes a wide selection of hiking.

                <p >Camping describes a range of activities and approaches to outdoor accommodation. Survivalist campers set off with as little as possible to get by, whereas recreational vehicle travelers arrive equipped with their own electricity, heat, and patio furniture. Camping may be combined with hiking, as in backpacking, and is often enjoyed in conjunction with other outdoor activities such as canoeing, climbing, fishing, and hunting. </p>
